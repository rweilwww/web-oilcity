        <h1>Oil City Trail</h1>
        The Oil City Trail offers a tour of historic Oil City. The trail begins where the McClintock Trail (page NE-71) meets Seneca St at the north end of Oil City. It goes through Oil City, mostly on city streets, to the city owned boat launch on the south side of town. From there it continues between the railroad and the river to the Oil City Wastewater Treatment Plant plant and the beginning of the Samuel Justus Trail (page NE-81. This trail is part of the Erie to Pittsburgh Trail (page NE-16). </p>

        The northern mile of the trail is mostly on city streets in Oil City, the middle mile is on residential streets, and the southern mile is on paved trail. Because of one-way streets in Oil City, the southbound and northbound routes between the McClintock Trail and the city boat launch are different. The signage is mostly good (Oct 2025s) in both directions.</p>
			<p class="Text">Southbound the route turns left/south from the McClintock Trail on to Seneca St, following sharrows<span class="Footnote-reference _idGenCharOverride-1"><span></span></span> for 0.6 miles to Sycamore St, where it turns right/west for a short block, then left/south. A block later it turns right/west to cross the Oil City Downtown Bridge on the walkway next to the railroad tracks. After crossing this bridge it follows the railroad tracks, first on one side then the other to US62/Petroleum St. At US62 it turns left/south toward the road bridge, staying for a short distance on the sidewalk. At the curb cut in the sidewalk it crosses the road (be careful) and turns left/south into the bike lane on the opposite side of US62. This crossing is mid-block, so it may preferable to continue on the sidewalk and cross at the other end of the bridge, where there is a traffic light. After crossing the bridge, the route continues on Petroleum St for three blocks before taking the right/west on West First St. Notice the grand houses along this street left over from the oil boom. In another half mile, the route turns right/north on Wyllis St, descending steeply for two blocks to the Oil City Boat Launch parking area. The trail is 1.9 miles in this direction.</p>
			<p class="Text">We also describe the northbound route from the Oil City Boat Launch parking area because it uses different streets, though it also crosses US62 and the Oil City Downtown bridges. Exiting the parking area, the trail immediately turns left/east on Front St and continues to US62/Petroleum St. A traffic light here facilities the crossing of US62 and left/north turn into the bike lane on the bridge, though caution is required for auto traffic in the intersection. At the end of the bridge, at the end of the jersey barriers, the route hops over to the sidewalk at the mid-block curb cut. It follows the road on the sidewalk for a short distance to the railroad tracks, where it turns right/west and follows the railroad tracks, first on one side then the other. </p>

			</div>
			<p class="photo-caption">Entering Oil City</p>
			<p class="Text">The trail continues across the Oil City Downtown Bridge on the walkway next to the railroad tracks. Immediately after crossing the bridge the trail turns right/south across the tracks and drops down a short grade into the parking lot for the Justus Park. It continues through the parking lot, under the bridge, and climbs the ramp to Elm St. There is a very tight left-right zig at the top of the ramp. At the McDonalds the trail continues straight on Elm St for two short blocks and one long block to the “T” intersection with Duncomb St. As the trail approaches Duncomb St, it crosses from the right lane into the left lane to facilitate the left/west turn on to Duncomb. It turns left/west on Duncomb, goes a block, and then turns right/north on Seneca St. About 0.4 miles later, just before the Route 8 bridge, the trail turns right/east on to the dike and the beginning of the McClintock Trail (page NE-71). The trail is 2 miles in this direction. </p>
			<p class="Text">South of the Oil City Boat Launch the same trail serves both the northbound and southbound traffic. The trail leaves the parking lot at the south end of the lot. A quarter-mile from the parking lot, just past the end of the chain link fence, the remains of a rod-line power system sits beside the trail. An interpretive sign explains how a single engine could power a dozen or more pumps with rods running across the oilfield. A reconstruction of a working transfer collar is visible, in action at Drake Well Museum near Titusville.</p>
			<p class="Text">After another quarter-mile, the trail arrives at Darr St where it jogs left and then right before the railroad tracks. A half mile later the trail arrives at the parking lot for the Oil City Wastewater Treatment Plant. Then in 0.3 miles the Oil City trail ends at the far end of the parking lot (MP129.1) where it connects with the Samuel Justus Trail (page NE-81).</p>
